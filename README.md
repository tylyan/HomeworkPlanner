This is a simple homework planning application written in Java developed for Android.

# WORK IN PROGRESS #

The application currently does not work at full functionality. It does not save data so we loaded some sample data for easier usability. Also, the edit and delete functions have not been implemented. The sorting works as well as creating new courses and new assignments.
